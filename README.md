# GO-game
Go is a two-player abstract strategy board game where the objective is to surround more territory on the board than your opponent. The game is played on a grid of intersections, and players take turns placing black or white stones on these intersections. The first player to move is black. The game ends when both players pass their turn, and the winner is the player with the most territory.
